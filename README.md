# Linear-Solvers

## Introduction
* Utilising __OOP__ and the __Eigen Library__, this software demonstrates the implementation of the __Jacobi__, __Gauss-Seidel__ and __Successive Over Relaxation (SOR)__ iterative methods for solving __Linear Algebraic Systems__, of the form, __Ax = b__.
* A __serial version__ is developed first, and then a __parallel version__.
* In the parallel case, __Performance Metrics__, such as __Speed-Up__ and __Efficiency__ will be calculated.

## Iterative Solvers

## Requirements
* __Compiler__: `g++ 13.1.0`.
* __OS__: `Ubuntu 20.04`.
* `OpenMP`.
* `CMake`.
* `Eigen`.
