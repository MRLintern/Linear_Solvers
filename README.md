# Linear-Solvers

## Introduction
* Utilising __OOP__ with __C++__ and the __Eigen Library__, this software demonstrates the implementation of the __Jacobi__, __Gauss-Seidel__ and __Successive Over Relaxation (SOR)__ iterative methods for solving __Linear Algebraic Systems__, of the form, __Ax = b__.
* A __serial version__ is developed first, and then a __parallel version__. A parallel version is developed so we can consider large systems of equations.
* In the parallel case, __Performance Metrics__, such as __Speed-Up__ and __Efficiency__ will be calculated.

## Iterative Solvers
* Below gives a brief overview of the algorithms.
### Jacobi Method
* TODO.
### Gauss-Seidel Method
* TODO.
### Successive Over Relaxation (SOR) Method
* TODO.
## Parallel Case
* TODO; the parallel case will make use of __OpenMP__.
## Requirements
* __Compiler__: `g++ 13.1.0`.
* __OS__: `Ubuntu 20.04`.
* `OpenMP`.
* `CMake`.
* `Eigen`.
